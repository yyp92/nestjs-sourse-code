等。\n当项目复杂之后，模块之间的关系错综复杂。\n这时候我们可以用 compodoc 生成一份文档，把依赖关系可视化。\ncompodoc 本来是给 angular 项目生成项目文档的，但是因为 angular 和 nest 项目结构类似，所以也支持了 nest。\n命令\nExample :# 创建个项目\nnest new compodoc-test\n\n# 安装 compodoc\nnpm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodoc\n\n# 然后生成一份文档\n# -p 是指定 tsconfig 文件\n# -s 是启动静态服务器\n# -o 是打开浏览器\nnpx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s -o\n\n# 在项目下加几个模块\nnest g resource aaa\nnest g resource bbb资料\n\ncompodoc\n\n比如 --theme 可以指定主题，一共有 gitbook,aravel, original, material, postmark, readthedocs, stripe, vagrant 这 8 个主题：\nExample :npx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s -o --theme postmark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
